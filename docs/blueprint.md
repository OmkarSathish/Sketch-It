# **App Name**: SketchAI

## Core Features:

- Drawing Canvas: A canvas where users can draw sketches.
- Sketch-to-Image Conversion: Use a generative AI tool to convert the sketch into a refined image based on user prompts, while applying edge detection from OpenCV to inform the generative model.
- Image Display: Display the generated image alongside the original sketch.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: White (#FFFFFF) for a clean and modern look.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for backgrounds and subtle UI elements.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Split-screen layout with the drawing canvas on one side and the generated image on the other.
- Simple, outlined icons for controls and prompts.
- Subtle fade-in animations for the generated images.
